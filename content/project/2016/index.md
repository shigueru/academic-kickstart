I collaborated in the study of magnetic nanoparticles of iron-carbon with core-shell structure. I investigated the variations of the energetic, magnetic and structural properties of iron nanoparticles coated with non-metallic elements such as oxygen, carbon, hydrogen and other functional groups. I used the molecular dynamics method implemented in the LAMMPS software. I also did the data analysis of the simulations with Python language and Ovito software.
