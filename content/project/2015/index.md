I collaborated in the study of thermal and structural properties of iron nanoparticles, aluminum nanoparticles and their nanoalloys. The nanoalloys had core-shell structure. I investigated different compositions and sizes during the heating and annealing processes at different temperatures. I used the molecular dynamics method implemented in LAMMPS software. I also did the data analysis of the simulations with Python language and Ovito software.
