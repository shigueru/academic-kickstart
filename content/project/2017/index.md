I investigated the electronic structure of Bismuth Ferrite (BiFeO3) and Yttrium Chromite (YCrO3) perovskites.For BiFeO3 the antiferromagnetic arrays type A and G were used. And for YCrO3 the antiferromagnetic arrays type A, C and G were used. I used ultra-smooth pseudopotentials together with the local density approximation considering the Hubbard parameter. I used the density functional theory (DFT) implemented in the Quantum ESPRESSO software.
