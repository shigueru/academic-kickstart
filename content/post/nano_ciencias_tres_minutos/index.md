The organization Red Nanoandes organized a contest with the objective of disseminating research projects related to nanosciences in the Latin American region. To this end, participants were asked to prepare videos in an informative format presenting the research they carried out during one of the following periods:

- Undergraduate
- Master
- Doctorate
- Post-doc

I prepared a video about my master's research **Electronic structure calculations in BiFeO3 and YCrO3 perovskites**. You can find more details in the following link: [Link](https://shiguerunagata.com/project/2017/)

The videos were judged by an international jury. My video came in third place and I obtained the bronze medal. The winning videos were presented in the first virtual edition of the fair **Perú con Ciencia** organized by the **Consejo Nacional de Ciencia, Tecnología e Innovación Tecnológica** (CONCYTEC). Within the fair my video was presented in the section **Nano science in 3 minutes** on Monday December 7, 2020 at 8 pm. You can see the video of the presentation at the fair below.
