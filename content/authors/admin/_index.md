I'm MSc. Physics from National University of Engineering. I'm a researcher in materials science. I research mechanical properties and electronic structure with density functional theory and molecular dynamics techniques. I use the softwares LAMMPS and Quantum ESPRESSO, I also use the Python language for data processing from computational simulations.

I am also interested in the use of machine learning techniques in materials science.
